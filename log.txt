What I want:
1. Show FDDL performs worse than our algorithm
What I did:
I run fddl with new setting (l1 type of outlier)
	Problem:
	fddl performance as high as 0.04
I need to check if my loading data is wrong
I checked 0 percent outlier, it was right and I tune FDDL & LRSDL paprameters

What I want:
1. Show FDDL performs worse than our algorithm
What I did:
I checked how the performance is fddl with 10% outlier
    Problem:
    It is really 0.02 accuracy using the method described in the paper of Li&Fu
I change the Pixel to random value first, and then normalize it
I check the performance of FDDL and LRSDL with 10% outlier
    Problem:
    LRSDL has performance not stable 0.7889 0.0123 0. 0234
I fixed a bug in lrsdl, the input for myshuffle
I checked the performance of f1
    Problem: how the choose the dimension Ptilde is hard, since Li&Fu are wrong
I followed Li&Fu to take all the dimensions, then tuning the dimension
    Problem: f1 performance is worse than fddl
I need to increase the power of outlier, I double check Li&Fu's paer
    Problem: their normalization is not make the sample norm to 1, but /255
I fix the bug in the code, I hope to repeat their results
I will start tuning FDDL again
Li & Fu are liers!

remove the normalization part for l1 type of outliers
the corrupted pixels all set to 255
re-run fddl and lrsdl to see the result, which is very slow

Next step:
run f1 f2 srrs1 to compare the result
but which dimension to choose is a question
if not beating fddl, only do l21 

further steps:
coil20 data set result
