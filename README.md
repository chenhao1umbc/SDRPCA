This repo is to run common and distinctive projection with clean dictionary
f1 is formulation 1 - without clean dictionary
f2 is formulation 2 - with cleaned dictionary
fddl is k0=0 version of LRSDL
lrsdl is Low rank shared dictionary learning
srrs1 is reproduce the correct SRRS (Li & Fu's paper)
srrs2 is the cleaned dictionary version of SRRS

tf1, tf2, tfddl, tlrsdl, tsrrs1, tsrrs2
are processing the toydata for quick reasult

toy data shows perfect results. However
This projected got stuck because fddl somehow has strong robust to outlier.
I restart the projectio see what is going on.
